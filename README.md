# Cpp2C

Examples showing how you can implement object-oriented
programming mechanisms such as dynamic dispatch, static dispatch,
and inheritance in C using structs and function pointers.

CAVEAT: This model is based on the assumption that
the C compiler will not re-order the fields
declared in the structs.
